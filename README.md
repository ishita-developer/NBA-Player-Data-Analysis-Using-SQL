# NBA-Player-Data-Analysis-Using-SQL
**NBA Player Data Analysis | SQL Project**    Executed SQL queries on an NBA dataset to classify players by career stage using `CASE`. Applied `AVG`, `MAX`, and `MIN` for performance metrics. Filtered data with `WHERE`, `AND`, and `OR`. Utilized `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` to analyze trends by position.
